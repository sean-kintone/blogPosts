## Organizing Content

### Folders

Folders are first separated into No/Low Code content, and Code Heavy Content. From there, new topics should have their own folders.

### Files

#### Articles
File names will generally describe the article content. Headers at the top of the file should indicate the publish date, and last date updated in applicable.

#### Images

When used in articles, all images should be referenced from the github raw. Unfortunately, this requires uploading images first, and then inserting them into the articles, however it allows the article to be posted on any platform, and prevents mischief.

IE, the image at the top of this readme is displayed thus:
`<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sean-kintone/blogPosts/main/common/logos/heart-logo-white-text.png" height="300">`

##### Common
Logos, team member photos etc should be placed in the common folder on the top level directory. This consists of:
* Graphics
* Logos
* Screenshots
* Team

##### Specific
Images should be placed in the same folder as the article they are used in. Images should be named with a brief descriptor, and a number if they are part of a series. IE, `Intro-1.jpg`, `Intro-2.jpg`, `DatabaseSetup-1.jpg`, `DatabaseSetup-2.jpg` etc.
