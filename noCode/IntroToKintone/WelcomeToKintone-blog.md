### With Kintone, you get things done fast.
## How fast?
### Let's create a Sales Lead Database in less than 5 minutes.

## Create the App

"Apps" are databases and data entry forms all in one. You can build yours from scratch, import an excel spreadsheet, or pick from our built in gallery of templates. Apps can be customized to reflect all kinds of data, right out of the box. In later posts, we'll show how to connect apps to popular services like google calendar or slack, without typing a line of code.

## Drag and Drop Some Fields

Your can further customize your app by dragging and dropping fields. Some fields are smart, with user look-up, calculation, or relational capabilities, some are simple text, number, or drop down menus.

## Collapse and Organize Some Fields

You can arrange the size and position of any field, to make the data entry process smoother for your team. Hide and collapse certain fields, and (Spoiler Alert) in later posts we'll show how to hide certain records, fields, or Apps from users.
